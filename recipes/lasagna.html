    <h2 class="title">Grandmas homemade lasagna</h2>
    <p class="disc">
      a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta sheets,
      typically layered with a rich and savory tomato-based meat sauce, creamy
      béchamel sauce, and generous amounts of melted cheese. These layers are
      stacked and baked until the pasta is tender and the cheese on top is
      golden and bubbly.

    <h3 class="ing">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li>
        9-12 lasagna noodles (oven-ready or boiled according to package
        instructions)
      </li>
      <li>
        1 pound (450g) ground beef or ground Italian sausage (you can also use a
        combination of both)
      </li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped (or 2 teaspoons dried basil)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried oregano)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="ol">
      <li>
        Prepare the Meat Sauce Heat a large skillet or saucepan over medium
        heat, add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the chopped onion and garlic and
        sauté until they become translucent. Add the ground beef or sausage and
        cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Stir in the
        crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Add the fresh basil and oregano (or
        dried herbs), and season with salt and pepper. Simmer the sauce for
        about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the flavors to
        meld together.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Prepare the Cheese Filling In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese,
        half of the shredded mozzarella, half of the grated Parmesan, and the
        egg. Mix everything together until well combined. Season the cheese
        mixture with a bit of salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cook the Lasagna Noodles If you're using oven-ready lasagna noodles,
        skip this step. If you have regular lasagna noodles, follow the package
        instructions to cook them until al dente. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Assemble the Lasagna Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking
        dish, start with a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom. Place a layer
        of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a portion of the
        cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat these layers until you run out
        of ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top. Sprinkle
        the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on the final meat sauce
        layer.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake the Lasagna Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, making sure
        it doesn't touch the cheese to prevent sticking. Bake in the preheated
        oven for about 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional
        10-15 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Serve Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before slicing to allow it
        to set. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Serve hot and enjoy your
        homemade lasagna! Remember to adjust the cooking times and temperatures
        as needed based on your oven's performance. If you have any more
        questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
