      <h3>Steps!</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the Meatballs</strong>
          <br />
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork,
          breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, milk, chopped onion, minced
          garlic, chopped parsley, and the egg. Season the mixture with salt and
          pepper. Mix everything together until well combined. Form the mixture
          into meatballs, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter, and place them on a
          plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the Tomato Sauce</strong>
          <br />
          In a large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add finely
          chopped onion and minced garlic and sauté until they become
          translucent. Add the tomatoes (either fresh, canned, crushed, or
          tomato paste) to the saucepan. Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and
          herbs of your choice (such as basil and oregano). If you prefer a
          sweeter sauce, add a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity. Let the
          sauce simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, stirring
          occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cook the Meatballs</strong>
          <br />
          Carefully place the meatballs into the simmering tomato sauce. Gently
          stir to coat the meatballs with the sauce. Cover the saucepan and let
          the meatballs simmer in the sauce for approximately 20-30 minutes or
          until they are cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve</strong>
          <br />
          Serve your delicious meatballs hot, either over cooked spaghetti, in a
          sub roll for sandwiches, or as an appetizer. Spoon some of the
          flavorful tomato sauce over the meatballs. Garnish with fresh herbs
          like basil or parsley for a burst of color and flavor.
