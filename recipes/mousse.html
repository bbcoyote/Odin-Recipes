      <li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    <ol class="ol">
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1: Melt Chocolate and Butter</strong>
        In a heatproof bowl, combine the chopped chocolate and unsalted butter.
        Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) or
        microwave in 20-second intervals, stirring until the chocolate and
        butter are completely melted and smooth. Allow it to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2: Whip the Egg Whites</strong>

        In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until
        soft peaks form. Gradually add half of the granulated sugar while
        continuing to beat. Beat until stiff, glossy peaks form.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3: Make the Chocolate Mixture</strong>

        In the bowl with the melted chocolate and butter, whisk in the egg yolks
        and vanilla extract until well combined.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4: Combine the Mixtures</strong>

        Gently fold one-third of the whipped egg whites into the chocolate
        mixture to lighten it. Carefully fold in the remaining egg whites until
        no white streaks remain, being gentle to maintain the mousse's airy
        texture.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Whip the Cream</strong>

        In another bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches stiff peaks. Fold
        the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until well combined.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Chill and Serve</strong>

        Spoon the chocolate mousse into serving glasses or bowls. Refrigerate
        for at least 2 hours, or until set.
      </li>
      <li>
        <br />
        <strong>Garnish and Enjoy </strong>
        Before serving, you can add a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of
        chocolate shavings as a garnish, if desired.
